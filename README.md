# Personality-Prediction-System
This is a personality prediction system based on the Myers Briggs Personality Prediction. This personality system is used to better understand personality in broader population.
This project uses 5 criterias of personality prediction:
  * extroversion
  * neuroticism
  * agreeableness
  * conscientiousness
  * openness

I have applied Unsupervised machine learning algorithm K-means to divided the personalities into 10 distinct types based on the dataset.

# Machine Learning
This is a project based on machine learning. 

Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer science which focuses on the use of data and algorithms to imitate the way that humans learn, gradually improving its accuracy.
There are two types of learnings:
  * Supervised learning: Supervised learning helps organizations solve a variety of real-world problems at scale, such as classifying spam in a separate folder from your inbox. Some methods used in supervised learning include neural networks, naïve bayes, linear regression, logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine (SVM).
  * Unsupervised learning: Ideal for exploratory data analysis, cross-selling strategies, customer segmentation, and image and pattern recognition. It’s also used to reduce the number of features in a model through the process of dimensionality reduction. Principal component analysis (PCA) and singular value decomposition (SVD) are two common approaches for this.

# K-means Clustering Algorithm
  K-Means Clustering is an Unsupervised Learning algorithm, which groups the unlabeled dataset into different clusters. Here K defines the number of pre-defined clusters that need to be created in the process, as if K=2, there will be two clusters, and for K=3, there will be three clusters, and so on.
